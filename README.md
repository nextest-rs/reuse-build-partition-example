# Nextest example: Reuse builds and partition test runs on GitHub Actions

This repository contains a working example showing how to use [cargo-nextest](https://nexte.st/) to
[reuse builds](https://nexte.st/book/reusing-builds) and [partition test
runs](https://nexte.st/book/partitioning) on GitHub Actions.

Use this example as a template to get started with your own project.
